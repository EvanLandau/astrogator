# astrogator
Software for performing astrogation.

Project Baseline Goals:
1. N-body physics, supporting lagrangian points, gravitational assists, etc.
2. Support for both short-burn and continuous-thrust rocket engines
3. Ability to create "route" from one orbit to another, and give a delta-v budget and required maneuvers
4. Ability to find transfer windows, or map at specific time

Eventual Goals:
1. GUI
2. Support orbital rendezvous
